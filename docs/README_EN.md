## Related Projects

- [Raycast-Easydict](https://github.com/tisfeng/Raycast-Easydict) is a Raycast extension of Easydict。

## Motivation

Looking up words and translating text is a very useful function in daily life. I have used many translation dictionaries, but I was not satisfied until I met Bob. [`Bob`](https://bobtranslate.com/) is an excellent translation software, but it is not open source and no longer provides free application updates since it hit the Apple Store.

As a developer and beneficiary of a lot of open source software, I think that there should be a free open source version of [Bob](https://github.com/ripperhe/Bob) in the world, so I made [Easydict](https://github.com/tisfeng/Easydict).

Now I use Easydict a lot every day, I like it very much, and I hope more people can know it and use it.

Open source makes the world better.

## Thanks

This project was inspired by [saladict](https://github.com/crimx/ext-saladict) and [Bob](https://github.com/ripperhe/Bob), and the initial version was developed based on [Bob](https://github.com/cheonvo/Bob). [Easydict](https://github.com/tisfeng/Easydict) has made many improvements and optimizations on the original project, and many features and UI are referenced from Bob, thanks to the original author [ripperhe](https://github.com/ripperhe).

> Bob is a translation and OCR software for macOS platform.
